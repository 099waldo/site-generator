# Site Generator

This is a custom website generator that takes webpage content files and encloses them in a template file. This makes it easy to make design changes across an entire website without a lot of effort. 

## Usage
Add your content html files to the content directory and a custom website template file.
```
gcc gs.c -o gs
./gs
```
This will generate the website and put it in the www directory.
